Suggested Device Types
----------------------

Each device should have a specific device type that can be queried by the Node
Identification command to determine what kind of device the node is.  The
purpose for this is mostly configuration.  This device type as well as the model
number and firmware version could be used by configuration software to look up
and indicate to the user the name of the device, what kind of firmware loading
algorithms to use, the configuration parameters that are available, etc.

Although not a requirement for the proper functioning of the network it seems
helpful enough to suggest a set of device types for CAN-FiX capable devices.

The following list gives some recommendations for device type codes.  This is by
no means exhaustive and is not required.

It is also recommended that each device, ship with it's default Node ID set to
the device type.  For simple installations this may keep the user from having to
set Node IDs at all.  The Node IDs can be changed with Node Specific Messages
easily enough in the cases where that is necessary.

The device types are separated into groups.  The first code in the group is
marked as General and can be used if the correct one cannot be found.  This list
will be updated from time to time.  See the section :ref:`Approval Process`
for more details on the revision process.
